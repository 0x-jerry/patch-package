"SNAPSHOT: patch-package fails when patch file is invalid

**ERROR** Failed to apply patch for package left-pad

  This error was caused because patch-package cannot apply the following patch file:

    patches/left-pad+1.1.3.patch

  If removing node_modules and trying again doesn't fix this, maybe there was
  an accidental change made to the patch file? If not, then it's probably a bug
  in patch-package, so please submit a bug report. Thanks!
