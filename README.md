# patch-package ðŸ“¦ðŸ‘Œ

## Don't use this

I made invalid assumptions about how the `prepare` hook is handled in npm. Yarn is better, but still not quite there yet.
I'll try to make it work, but for now you need to manually type `patch-package` after doing a `yarn remove`. Look at the
history to see the old docs.
